# Troubleshooting

If SaltyNX was not injected or it crashed, you will see... Red Screen of Death.
![error_image](https://github.com/masagrator/SaltyNX-Tool/blob/master/error.jpg?raw=true)

If you will see red text with first line "SaltyNX is not injected!!", check if files were copied properly and try to restart Switch. Otherwise it means CFW can't handle it.
