# How to use cheats in Atmosphere

Cheats loaded by Atmosphere when game is booting are crashing OS. To avoid it I added to SaltyNX-Tool function for renaming cheats folders in Atmosphere/titles and in Atmosphere/contents.

If you want to use SaltyNX plugins with cheats, You need to go in this order:

>Disable Cheats in SaltyNX-Tool
>
>Run game and wait for first sign of game loading after Nintendo logo will disappear
>
>Enable Cheats in SaltyNX-Tool
>
>Use Edizon or Checkpoint to apply cheats

# Troubleshooting

If SaltyNX was not injected properly or at all, you will see... Red Screen of Death.
![error_image](https://github.com/masagrator/SaltyNX-Tool/blob/master/error.jpg?raw=true)

If you will see red text with first line "SaltyNX was not injected!!", check if files were copied properly. Otherwise it means CFW can't handle it.
