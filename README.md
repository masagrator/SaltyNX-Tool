# Troubleshooting

If SaltyNX was not injected, it crashed or SaltyNX-Tool can't check if it's running, you will see... Red Screen of Death.
![error_image](https://github.com/masagrator/SaltyNX-Tool/blob/master/error.jpg?raw=true)

If you will see red text with first line:
- "SaltyNX is not injected!!" - check if files were copied properly and try to restart Switch. 
- "Checking SaltyNX is not possible! Run homebrew in Applet mode!" - run homebrew from Album hbmenu

Otherwise it means CFW can't handle it.
